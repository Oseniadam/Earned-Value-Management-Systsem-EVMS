# Earned-Value-Management-Systsem-EVMS
Earned Value Management Systems allow the project manager to answer the following three questions, as they relate to the project:

1.  Where have we been?

2.  Where are we now?

3.  Where are we going?

In Earned Value Management there are three Data Sources:

– the budget (or planned) value of work scheduled
– the actual value of work completed
– the “earned value” of the physical work completed

Earned Value takes these three data sources and compares 

1. the budgeted value of work scheduled with 

2. the “earned value of physical work completed” and 

3. the actual value of work completed.

# Planned Value
Planned Value describes how far along project work is supposed to be at any given point in the project schedule and cost estimate. 

Cost and Schedule baseline refers to the physical work scheduled and the approved budget to accomplish the scheduled work. 

Together, they result in an important value: Planned Value (PV).
PV can be looked at in two ways: cumulative and current.

Cumulative PV is the sum of the approved budget for activities scheduled to be performed to date. 
Current PV is the approved budget for activities scheduled to be performed during a given period. 
This period could represent days, weeks, months, etc.

PV, also known as Budget Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS), can be defined as:

**Define Scope** : What you are tasked to do (Scope Statement)
**Assign Scope** : Breakdown scope into manageable parts (WBS)
**Schedule Scope** : Time-phased, logic driven with critical path (Project Schedule)
**Budget Scope** : Develop cost (budget) for all approved scope (Performance Measurement Baseline)

#  Baseline
##  Performance Measurement Baseline
### What performance measurement will be based upon.
# Actual Costs
Actual Cost (AC), also called actual expenditures, is the cost incurred for executing work on a project. This figure tells you what you have spent and, as with Planned Value, can be looked at in terms of cumulative and current. Cumulative AC is the sum of the actual cost for activities performed to date. Current AC is the actual costs of activities performed during a given period. This period could represent days, weeks, months, etc. AC is also called Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).

# Earned Value**
To report the accomplishments of the project, you must apply Earned Value (EV) to the figures and calculations in the project. EV is the quantification of the “worth” of the work done to date. In other words, EV tells you, in physical terms, what the project has accomplished. As with PV and AC, EV can be presented in a Cumulative and Current fashion. Cumulative EV is the sum of the budget for the activities accomplished to date. Current EV is the sum of the budget for the activities accomplished in a given period. Earned Value is also called Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).

# Planned Value** (PV) is determined by the cost and schedule baseline. 

# Actual Cost** (AC) is determined by the actual cost incurred on the project. 
Earned Value (EV) tells you, in physical terms, what the project accomplished.

# Variance Analysis
PMI’s PMBOK® Guide defines a variance as “a quantifiable deviation, departure, or divergence away from a known baseline or expected value” (PMI, 2004, p. 379). As the project planning components become known, the scope and quality, schedule, and cost estimate. The project manager will review with the project’s sponsor or client to seek approval. When approval is granted the project has established a planning baseline or time-phased cost plan. Also, the project manager will be provided with financial information from accounting that will expressed the actual cost incurred on the project s work is performed, then the project manager will seek information from the team that will state the budgeted cost of work performed on the project, or earned value. After those three values are established, a variance analysis can be performed. There are two basic expressions of variance, schedule variance and cost variance.

# Schedule Variance
Schedule Variance status does indicate the dollar value difference between work that is ahead or behind the plan and reflects a given measurement method

Schedule Variance status does not address impact of work sequence, address importance of work, reflect critical path assessment, indicate amount of time it will slip, identify source (labor & material) of difference, indicate the time ahead/behind (or regain) schedule, nor indicate the cost needed to regain schedule.

The formula utilized to express schedule variance is project earned value minus the project planned value as of the date of examination. (SV = EV – PV) If the variance is equal to 0, the project is on schedule. If a negative variance is determined, the project is behind schedule and if the variance is positive the project is ahead of schedule.

# Cost Variance
The cost variance is defined as the 
“difference between earned value and actual costs."
(CV = EV – AC)

(PMI, 2004, p. 357) Sometimes this formula is expressed as the difference between budgeted cost of work performed and actual cost work performed. 
If the **variance is equal to 0**, the project is on budget. 
If a **negative variance** is determined, the project is over budget and
if the **variance is positive** the project is under budget.
